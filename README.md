# Bank Customer Churn Classification
Customer churn classification is a predictive modeling technique used to identify customers who are likely to discontinue their relationship with a business. It involves analyzing historical data to build models that can accurately predict which customers are at risk of churning. By understanding churn patterns, businesses can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and minimize revenue loss. Key features such as customer behavior, demographics, and interactions are typically used to train these models.
