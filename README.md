# Bank Customer Churn Classification
Customer churn classification is a predictive modeling technique used to identify customers who are likely to discontinue their relationship with a business. It involves analyzing historical data to build models that can accurately predict which customers are at risk of churning. By understanding churn patterns, businesses can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and minimize revenue loss. Key features such as customer behavior, demographics, and interactions are typically used to train these models.Customer turnover, or losing customers to a business, is a critical concern for banks that want to maintain a stable and profitable customer base. This project aims to address bank customer turnover using machine learning techniques and predictive analytics.

Problem Statement
In the competitive banking sector, customer retention is vital for profitability, as attracting new clients costs more than keeping current ones. Churn, the act of clients ending their bank relationship, poses significant financial risks. Banks are now utilizing predictive analytics and machine learning to forecast potential churn using historical customer data.

Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of historical customer data including various characteristics such as demographics, transaction history, customer behavior and more. The main goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to drop in the future. 

The main stages of this project are data processing, exploratory data analysis, feature design and selection of a suitable machine learning algorithm. Several algorithms are tested and evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting customer turnover. Performance metrics such as precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score are used to evaluate model performance.
In addition, the insights gained from the analysis are used to provide the bank with effective recommendations to forecast customer turnover. This could include targeted marketing campaigns, better customer service or customized retention strategies. The goal of this project is to give the bank the tools and information it needs to reduce customer turnover, improve customer satisfaction, and improve its bottom line.
